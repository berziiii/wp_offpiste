								Over the better part of a decade, I’ve been deviating from the expected path and taking the path less traveled. Prior to my web development career, I established myself as a nationally accredited, Free-Style Ski Coach. From the hills of central Virginia, to the breathtaking Sierra Nevada Mountains in Lake Tahoe, California, my passion for helping young-skiers achieve their goals came to life.  I tailored my coaching skills to address the individual learning needs of my students, and pushed them in unconventional ways to surpass their goals. I began to implement this approach in everything I did.
							</p>
							<p>
								From the exquisite Lake Tahoe, I transitioned my career from coaching to the realm of recruiting. I believe my transition to be successful because of my rooted desire to help people achieve their goals, and the “off-piste” manner in which I do so.

							</p>
							<p>
								Tapping into my deeply buried, nerdy, ex-gamer side, I began to concentrate my recruiting efforts towards placing Web Designers and Web Developers; I became the Web Development Specialist at Vitamin T for the Washington, D.C. market.

							</p>
							<p>
								It was while working with these creative-professionals, that I came to this crossroad where my desire to help my clients achieve their goals and my very own passion for web development collided. In order to better understand the market, these working professionals, and my clients’ unique needs (as well as pursue my own budding passion!) I enrolled in a Front-End Development program at General Assembly. After graduating from this engaging and rewarding program, my understanding of web principles, languages and frameworks entered a new frontier. By merging my revamped technical skills with an untapped creative intuition, it acted as a catalyst that jump-started my web development career.
							</p>
							<p>
								My philosophy on creative web development is simple: create ideas that deliver an unconventional experience, provide the tools necessary to help direct audiences to the desired goal and lastly, have fun doing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let me help you effectively connect with your digital audiences through a unique, off-the-beaten-path approach utilizing designs that deviate from what is conventional, usual or expected!
